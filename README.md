This test automation framework uses BDD to test the CRUD features of the database: http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers.
The scenarios can be run using the TestRunner and the output in the form of an extent report will be saved in the output folder in the class path.
Cukedoctor has been configured and can be used to generate Living Documentation by running the cukedoctor.execute Maven plugin. The Living Documentation will be saved in the target/cukedoctor folder in the class path.
